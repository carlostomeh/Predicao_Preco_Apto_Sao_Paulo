## üìÑ Results

We test 8 regression models in this problem and the best results was made by Random Forest Regressor and the ensemble methods like AdaBoost and Gradient Bosting. Our main goal was beat baseline RSME score in test set, and we did it as you can see below: 

- Results in Test Set

| MODEL | RMSE | R¬≤ | 
| ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Baseline - Analysts Price | 208.432 | 0.912 |
| Ada Boost Regressor | 196.459 | 0.922 |
| Random Forest Regressor | 230.837 | 0.892 |

## Next Steps

- Clean outliers
- Add feature selection algorithms.
- Improve streamlit application adding new geographic visualization.
